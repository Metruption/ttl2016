This repository is extra goodies that people who were at a talk I gave at TechTalkLive 2017. The title of the talk is "Replacing QR Codes on Fliers: Exploiting Bystanders'  Trust".

Info on various ways of formatting encoded data in QR codes so that scanners interpret it as an address book contact or other thing can be found [here](https://github.com/zxing/zxing/wiki/Barcode-Contents). At least one of the links on that is dead, I reccoment using the archive.org wayback machine to visit them.
@todo(you): make a pull request in that repo to replace the dead links

RedirectLogQ was mentioned multiple times. Its source code lives on GitHub over [here](https://www.github.com/metruption/redirectlogq) and is licensed under verion three of the GPL.

Also in this repo are the slides I used and the outline I based the talk off of.

Enjoy :)
